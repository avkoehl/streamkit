# streamkit

A python toolkit for terrain-based stream network processing.

## Overview

streamkit provides tools for analyzing and manipulating stream networks derived
from DEMs. It repackages and extends functionality from several great libraries
(pysheds, hyriver, whitebox, etc.) to be more convenient to use in my workflows
that use rioxarray to represent raster data.
